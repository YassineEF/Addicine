# Addicine
# Work with API
I built this project to learn the MVC pattern, to learn how to communicate with a API and to use what i learn about OOP.
This project was a exercise given us from our tutor and the instruction was clear, create a site that have a very simple design but that have a MVC pattern and some API calls.
To build this project i used CURL to download data and wich can communicate with an API, iused CURL caus i want to privilage PHP over Javcascript and that's why i don't used Axios/ajax/fetch.
In my Controllers i have all the data i get from curling from the API.
In my Model i have my class to initiate curl and return trhe data?.
In my views i have all my templates to show what i returned in my controllers.

My MVC is not 100% clear beacuse i just learn it and i suerly gonna refactor this code.

# How to install & run the Project
First of you need is download the project, to create a .env file in the views table and write into it your API key.
Then you need to donwload the SSL certificate from the API site and put it in the models folder.
Now if you have XAMPP or WAMP you need to put it on and go on your localhost and search for www folder where you put your project go into yout project, go into app folder, go into views folder and then dshow the home.php
If you want change the style you need to download node and then run the command to run sassand change the scss file.
